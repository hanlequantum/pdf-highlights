# About

This is a script that extracts annotations (highlights, comments,
etc.) from a PDF file, and formats them as plain text.

At present, the following annotations are supported:

 * Highlights without an attached comment are output first, as
   "highlights" with just the highlighted text included.

 * Highlights with an attached comment, and text annotations (not
   attached to any particular text/highlight) are output next, as
   "detailed comments".

 * Underline, strikeout, and squiggly underline annotations are output
   last, as "Nits", with or without an attached comment. The intention
   of this is to easily separate formatting or grammatical corrections
   from more substantial comments about the content of the document.

For each annotation, the page number is given, along with the
associated (highlighted/underlined) text, if any. Additionally, if the
documents includes outlines (aka bookmarks) such as those generated by
the hyperref package, those are also used to identify to which section
in the document the annotation refers.
